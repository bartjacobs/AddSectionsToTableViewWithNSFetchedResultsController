### Add Sections to Table View With NSFetchedResultsController and Swift 3

#### Author: Bart Jacobs

[Earlier in this series](https://cocoacasts.com/series/core-data-with-nsfetchedresultscontroller-and-swift-3/), I already mentioned that the `NSFetchedResultsController` class was designed for table viewsâ€”and collection views. This also means that it has no problem managing hierarchical data to populate a table view with sections.

In this tutorial, we add sections to the table view of quotes. Each section contains the quotes of a particular author. If you want to follow along, clone or download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/bartjacobs/RespondToUpdatesUsingTheNSFetchedResultsControllerDelegateProtocol).
